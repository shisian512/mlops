Configuration Steps Outside the DAG
To make the code above run successfully, you need to perform the following setup steps in your AWS and Airflow environment:

Upload Scripts to S3: Upload all your PySpark scripts (s3_ingestion.py, s3_preprocess.py, etc.) to the specified S3 location, e.g., s3://your_s3_bucket_name/scripts/.

Configure Airflow Connections:

In the Airflow UI, go to Admin > Connections.

Find or create a connection with conn_id="spark_default".

Configure this connection to point to your Amazon EMR cluster. You'll need to specify the host, port, and other details.

Set up DVC:

On the Airflow worker machine where the BashOperator will run, you must install DVC and the AWS CLI.

Run dvc init and dvc remote add to configure your S3 bucket as the DVC remote storage. The DVC metadata files (.dvc) should also be pushed to S3 so they are accessible from anywhere.

Manage AWS Credentials:

Instead of a local .env file, the most secure and scalable way to provide AWS credentials is to configure the IAM role for your Airflow worker and your EMR cluster to have the necessary permissions for S3 and DynamoDB.

Alternatively, you can set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as Airflow Variables in the UI. Your PySpark scripts can then access them from the environment.
