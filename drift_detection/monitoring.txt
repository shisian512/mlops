from prometheus_client import Gauge, start_http_server

drift_metric = Gauge("drift_score", "Drift score from Evidently")
drift_metric.set(drift_score)
start_http_server(8000)


alert rules:
- alert: HighDriftScore
  expr: drift_score > 0.5
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Drift score exceeded threshold"


Best Practices
✅ Use thresholds based on historical drift patterns.

✅ Combine alerts with retraining triggers or rollback logic.

✅ Route alerts by severity (e.g., Slack for info, PagerDuty for critical).

✅ Avoid false positives by using for: in Prometheus or debounce logic in Python.
